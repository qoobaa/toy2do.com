          Hi there! I'm Magdalena, a happy young mum. I've also been working
          as a teacher, supporting kids with various needs, including
          visually impaired.
        </p>

        <p>
          I understand how important it is to provide kids with materials
          adapted to their age and needs, to stimulate their development in
          a fun way.
        </p>

        <p>
          That inspired me to start making toys for babies. My
          contrastive black/white/red toys help the little ones practise
          their eyesight, and a variety of textures and sounds stimulate
          their senses, giving them joy as well! The toys are also
          suitable for blind and visually impaired children.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my home section you'll find toys for bigger kids (adults).
