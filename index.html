        Hi there! I'm Magdalena, a happy young mum. I've also been working
        as a teacher, supporting kids with various needs, including
        visually impaired.<br>

        I understand how important it is to provide kids with materials
        adapted to their age and needs, to stimulate their development in
        a fun way.<br>

        That inspired me to start making toys for babies. My contrastive
        black/white/red toys help the little ones to practise their
        eyesight, and a variety of textures and sounds stimulate their
        senses, giving them joy as well! The toys are also suitable for
        blind and visually impaired children.<br>

        In my home section you'll find toys for bigger kids (adults).
